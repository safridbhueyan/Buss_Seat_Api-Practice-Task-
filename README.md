## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with the **Buss_seat** app development environment, so you can run the app locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Flutter SDK**: Follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- **Dart SDK**: Flutter comes with Dart, so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.
- **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** for development.
- An **Android** or **iOS** emulator, or a real device to run the app.

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/backbencherstudio/Buss_seat_app(practice Task).git
